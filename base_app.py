    Description: This file is used to launch a minimal streamlit web
	application. You are expected to extend the functionality of this script
	as part of your predict project.

Companies who offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with consumer values and ideals. The objective of this project is to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat based on their tweets. This would add to the companies market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received. The task of this predict is to create a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data. Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories, thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies""")

		st.markdown("""Through exploratory data analysis we have found that certain words appear in the sentiments more often than others. For example those leaning to the "non man made" opinion often tweet tweets that cointain words that can be link to conspiratorial speech whilst those on the "pro man made" side often have tweets that contain words like "scientist" and more often have links to no twitter sites, we can view these as arguments made by those individuals with evidence to back up their claims. We also noted that those same individuals have, in general, longer tweet lengths which strangthens the arguemnt that they use facts to back up their claims as opposed to the individuals of the "non man made" opinion """)
