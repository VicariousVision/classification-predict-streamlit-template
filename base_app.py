    Description: This file is used to launch a minimal streamlit web
	application. You are expected to extend the functionality of this script
	as part of your predict project.

Companies who offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with consumer values and ideals. The objective of this project is to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat based on their tweets. This would add to the companies market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received. The task of this predict is to create a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data. Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories, thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies""")
